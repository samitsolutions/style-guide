# How To Name Image Files


## Summary

- 2-6 descriptive keywords organized in descending order of importance
- all separated by hyphens, and 
- all lower case letters. Some basic examples of this practice are: 
  - website-image-file-name-instructions.jpg
  - photograph-collection-framed-prints-home.jpg
  - developer-networking-meeting-norfolk-virginia.jpg


An image that is ready to be used on a website will meet these requirements:

- All lowercase characters.
- No spaces or underscore characters.
- Use hyphens to separate words.
- No other special characters except hyphens.
- Don't use prepositions (e.g., for, in) or definite articles (the word the).
- No keyword spamming.
- The first five words are indexable by search engines, so they should accurately describe what the image is about in decreasing order of importance.
- Everything after the fifth word can be identifying information for use by the developer or image owner. (e.g., serial number, date, resolution, photographer name, source)
- Use only .jpg images. (No .tiff, .bmp, .png, .heic, etc. Convert before sending.)
