# How To Name Image Files


## Summary
At a minimum, make your image filenames (1) five descriptive keywords organized in descending order of importance, (2) all separated by hyphens, and (3) all lower case letters. Some basic examples of this practice are:


An image that is ready to be used on a website will meet these requirements:

- All lowercase characters.
- No spaces or underscore characters.
- Use hyphens to separate words.
- No other special characters except hyphens.
- Don't use prepositions (e.g., for, in) or definite articles (the word the).
- No keyword spamming.
- The first five words are indexable by search engines, so they should accurately describe what the image is about in decreasing order of importance.
- Everything after the fifth word can be identifying information for use by the developer or image owner. (e.g., serial number, date, resolution, photographer name, source)
- Use only .jpg images. (No .tiff, .bmp, .png, .heic, etc. Convert before sending.)
